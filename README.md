# Advent of code 2023

These are my solutions to advent of code 2023, written in rust.

Each day's solution is split in a binary target file. To run one day's tests:

```
cargo test --bin day_<day-number>
```

To get one day's solution - make sure you have stored the input string at the
correct location:

```
cargo run --bin day_<day-number>
```
